The delivery was frustrating and unsatisfactory. UPS mail innovations has caused delays in the delivery of our book boxes more than once, but this time it was extremely slow. Tracking information showed that our book box was in Denver (our town, same as delivery address) beginning Tuesday, Dec. 13, “pending acceptance.” On Thursday, Dec. 15, that had not changed, so I went to the post office to inquire about it. The clerk told me it wasn’t there, in spite of the tracking info to the contrary. He said as soon as they received it and checked it in, it would be out for delivery. On Friday the 16th, the tracking info showed it was out for delivery. On Saturday the 17th, I received an email saying it had been delivered. Monday the 19th, I checked with one of our administrators, and she said they had checked the mailbox earlier that morning but there was no mail. I went to the mailbox after that, and found our book box, along with other mail. I was very relieved to see it on Monday, since Tuesday the 20th was our last day of school, and I had two families waiting for books. UPS service is usually timely and reliable. When the post office is involved, the quality of service declines. I am disappointed about that, because I want the USPS to be timely and reliable, but they’re not. I recognize that there may be increased cost associated with using UPS to deliver all the way to the customer, and I understand the need to reduce costs. I just want you to be aware that reducing the financial cost of delivery also carries a reduction in the quality of service to your customers.",,"The tracking of my shipment, while convenient, was inaccurate.

All 3 were supposedly “guaranteed” to be delivered within a certain number of days so they could be distributed to students before December break began. In addition to the paid student orders I had also placed orders for myself, and am disappointed that these books will not arrive in time for Christmas. While I understood that there could be potential delays in shipping, I received multiple notices from Scholastic over the last few weeks saying my order would arrive the next day or with incorrect delivery estimates. This is very unfortunate since I feel responsible for making sure the students received their orders on time, and they didn’t. While I have been a member of Scholastic Book Clubs for years, I had avoided it recently due to these shipping delays, and I thought things had been rectified. Obviously the post office is busy at this time of the year, but when people can order books on Amazon and get overnight delivery or visit a local bookstore and get books immediately I think it would be wise to give more accurate estimates for delivery in the future. For example, I could have told the families to submit their orders by an earlier date if I had known they wouldn’t arrive on time. Luckily I personally got many books for my own children in my November order since I was worried about shipping, but I hope my students and their families are not too disappointed and will continue to place orders in the future.",,I do not know if my orders are complete since I have still not received any of them.,No,,No,No,Teacher Home Shipment,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1671828353249_13684

These are Christmas books that the student (and I as a classroom teacher) will not feel like reading once we are back to school.  I would not have ordered the items if Scholastic had not indicated they would arrive before our school was out on Dec. 22nd.  As I said we still haven't received the books.  Because of this and other orders in the past not arriving in the time frame I am not sure how often I will order anymore.  I have spent thousands of dollars on books for my students and my classroom over the years and I am disappointed over the last year.  I realize that there are still supply chain issues and it is hard to find workers, but please do not promise books by a certain date if they cannot be delivered.",,,No,,No,Yes,Teacher School Shipment,https://scholasticnso.satmetrix.com/app/core/main/home.jsp#actions/1671828205165_3628

My order was promised by Dec. 16th but did not arrive in time before the holiday break.  I contacted Scholastic; the lady was very kind and helpful and resent the order to my house.  Fortunately I was still in town when it arrived, and I was able to deliver the books to the family who had ordered.  Again I don't think it's Scholastic's fault per say as I believe Scholastic sent the order out the next day.  I think it was likely a delay with UPS as it appeared to be stuck at a facility in Ohio for some time. The original book box was delivered to my school after we returned from the break.

So much so, that I decided to no longer do the Scholastic Book Club monthly orders. This year I heard that the company worked hard and solved the problem, so I decided to give them another shot. In emails and on flyers, it stated to place my order before a certain date and the order would come in a week and a half before Christmas as many of my families placed orders for the holidays and planned on giving them as gifts. After deciding to give it another shot, I was left incredibly disappointed as my order did not show up at the time I was promised. I understand the holidays being a busier time of year with deliveries, but I was putting my trust in this company to follow through with their word, and once again, I was let down by a business that holds themselves very highly and left to deal with the added stress of communicating to upset parents as to why their Christmas presents for their family members had not arrived yet.   I did reach out to customer service and they were able to resend my package which came the last day of school before vacation. This was a half day and the package did not arrive until mid afternoon when the students had already been dismissed and I had left the building for the week. Customer service did provide me with a variety of coupon codes that I'm not quite sure how to use which I admit was kind, but I just want this business to understand the impact they have and the impact of their words.

I always get there and never really know what I want plus I am trying to stay within the usually $10 range so when I get one book picked out and only have $2 or $3 left to spend I need to be able to search for books that are just that dollar amount rather than waisting my time trying to find something that is around that amount. So it would be helpful to have the ability to search different ways there.,,I have been a Scholastic teacher for almost 20 years now and have only expereinced a few issues over the years so this is truly a great compnay. Plus Scholastic allows me to be able to afford to put a new book every month during the school year in each of my students hands!
