2/21/2023 19:40,460110064698,Parent/Family Member,2, My issue was that UPS updated my package as delivered. When I searched my porch and front yard and rewatched my cameras it was very obvious that UPS did not deliver the package to my door. UPS said to contact the sender. My initial request was asking what steps I needed to take since my package was not delivered to my door. I was willing to do whatever the proper method of reporting was. The first response was UPS said they delivered it to your house so look again. When I responded again that I did the obvious as well as checked my cameras the second response was they confirmed with UPS it was delivered look again. It was very frustrating to be told to check my 3 by 3 front door area as if it could be hidden somewhere. All I was requesting was what to do to file that the package was not delivered. The 3rd person to respond did resolve it. They started the process to send a new package which is greatly appreciated but also gave me the true instructions on how to file a claim with UPS and said next time do this. This was all I was looking for from the beginning. If the first email would have just simply say UPS said it was delivered please check again but if you can not find it here is what needs done to file a claim I would have been more than happy to go through those channels.,Order Fulfillment & Shipping,Delivered Package Not Found,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,3,,first name last name,courtney.siglar@yahoo.com,2/21/2023

I think the hardest part of this whole this was two fold 1- my special needs child was so sad when his classmates got their orders and his wasn’t in the class book order. Try explaining that to an intellectually disabled child with autism, it wasn’t my favorite parenting moment. And I understand disappointment, but this wasn’t his fault nor should he have been in this sad position. 2 - after the first call the issue was supposed to have been resolved, after the second and third  call I was promised our books would be delivered directly to our home. After the fourth call I just was so over it I asked for a refund.   I don’t even know if these comments get read. But after being a teacher for more than 18 years subscribing to your printables,  completing thousands of dollars worth of book orders, and buying scholastic over Amazon my loyalty to your company has shifted and I will be stopping.

Now I am going to have to refund money (which was in the form of a check made out to Scholastic for the amount of those items not available) or ask parents to submit new checks----both options require more time!  There isn't even an option to order those books and have them sent at a later date.  It surprises me that as a book company you can't keep up with the demands for a book in your current February Flyer.  The students are very disappointed to say the least.
