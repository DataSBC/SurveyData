Just list them and create a column that shows how to purchase it. There's shouldn't be one catalog for book club, one catalog for non book clubs, one invisible catalog if a teacher decides to order through a rep. It is impossible to ascertain whether you have any particular title available. Also, at the very least let your book club service reps access the non book club catalogs and vice versa. Secondly, what is your fixation with getting teachers involved in the parent ordering process? It literally took me four minutes yesterday to rubber stamp a parent order. Why??? Not necessary. And if I don't approve it, the books never ship out. And it takes forever to get your books! The whole system is so terribly antiquated it is like pulling teeth ordering through the web site! I still don't even know if I can purchase the Spanish translations of the Guardians of Ga'hoole series through your site. Probably have to get a rep involved.

However, I am disappointed in Scholastic overall. My question was about finding books with LGBTQ+ characters in the Book Club/flyers. There weren't any! The representatives directed me to where I could purchase some titles under the Teacher Store and the Scholastic store. Obviously they don't have the ability to add them to the book club/flyers. That isn't their responsibility. But whoever makes decisions about book purchasing for the book clubs should know-- I won't be the only one to have noticed the lack of LGBTQ+ content/characters in the books. I appreciate that you've provided a diverse books flyer, but the fact that it excludes books with LGBTQ+ characters is concerning. Thank you for your time.

The parent paid and it was shown to her to be there.  When I went to my cart, it was gone. Due to the timing, I couldn't resolve it. (December) I had to wait until we came back to school in January. Resolve is just we don't have the books, here is your money back. As the teacher, I'm upset because I feel this will damage the parent's drive to buy her son books. She may not do that again. It isn't just the bonus points for me, it's that fact that he is a struggling reader and participant in school, but I feel that by ordering books, he will engage more and have happier memories of school. I do have to give credit the parent's money is being refunded, as it should. Thank you.",Other,Other,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,first name last name,huckebyr@adapss.com,1/10/2023

Their response was that I had the book in my cart, I just needed to push the order through electronically. I tried explaining that it was actually the book I tried to order but couldn't because I didn't know the birthdate of the student. They responded saying they did not understand what the issue was.

The invoice she sent to me noted an adjustment for the tax originally charged, leaving our total at $29.  HOWEVER, our credit card statement showed the full amount of $30.81, which included tax.  I called Scholastic numerous times sometimes to no answer, sometimes had a very poor (inaudible) connection.  Finally, via email, i was assured that the tax had been credited back to the card, even receiving an emailed letter/receipt on January 5.  Today (1//9/23), I have yet to see the credit back to the card used. Honestly, I realize that $1.81 is not a lot of money.  Unfortunately, it is also something that I need to report to & justify to our business office, and I have now spent far too much time following up on the issue, without resolution.

Good evening,  I apologize about the delay in sending you this e-mail. I wanted to make sure all the information that I'm giving you is accurate and correct, so that you can get as much help as possible.   I went ahead and inquired into the legacy bonus point coupons that you have, and we are more than happy to see what we can do regarding getting those rewards applied to your account. In order to do this, it is recommended you make copies of the original bonus point coupons for your records, and then mail in the original slips to our Book Clubs payments address for evaluation. The Book Clubs payments address is included below, for your convenience.   Scholastic Inc. Book Club  Po BOX: 630446  Cincinnati, OH 45263-0446  Fax Number: 800-223-4011  Additionally, with the coupons, you will need to include your current account information, preferably your account number and name. This process can take several weeks to resolve, so I do apologize in advance for any inconvenience, but I do feel passionately about getting our teachers the rewards they deserve for all of their service, so I wanted to give you as much information as possible. I will say there is no guarantee that these will be able to be successfully added to your account, however I do hope this information was helpful and I would like to thank you for your patience with Scholastic today.

A new box appeared that said I already had a chat box open, please click to move the conversation. I clicked to move the conversation but nothing happened. I got frustrated, closed all windows, and gave up. I wanted to know how to receive a class set of flyers.  I have not been receiving them this year, so I have not placed any orders.

I asked if there was a way that I could receive some of the benefits offered to classroom teachers.  I buy books and let my students ""earn"" them, as many of my students have few, if any, books at home.  The responder asked me if I wanted a homeschooling account??  I asked for more information, and then was asked if I wanted a teacher's account.",Customer Service,CS Experience,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,first name last name,k_long@vwcs.net,1/4/2023

1/5/2023 13:36,457875310991,Teacher/Educator,2,"I keep asking for the monthly paper flyers to be sent to my school, early, like 2 weeks before the month of the flyers. I would like ALL possible flyers for TK -Kindergarten students. They love to physically “shop” through the flyers with an orange marker every month, then take them home to their parents   I never get these flyers anymore, even with repeated requests. If one packet (I.e., “Firefly”, does arrive, it’s already 2 weeks INTO the new month….waaay too late for the seasonal books to be sent! Can anything be done? Please mail me the pre-school through TK flyers….all flyers (gift books, special topics, plus the regular flyers for these grade levels.) Thank you so much.
